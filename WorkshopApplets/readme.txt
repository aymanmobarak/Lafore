These are the applets that accompany the book "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java,"
Second Edition. Robert Lafore, 2002

The applets are little demonstration programs that clarify the topics in the book.
For example, to demonstrate sorting algorithms, a bar chart is displayed and, each
time the user pushes a button on the applet, another step of the algorithm is
carried out. The user can see how the bars move, and annotations within the
applet explain what's going on.

Readers will not need the source code for these applets. They are simply an
interactive visual aid for the book. Therefore only .class and
.html files are available on the Sams web site.
